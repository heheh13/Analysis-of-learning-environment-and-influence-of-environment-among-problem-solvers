Basically, it’s a research based on competitive programmers. Through the whole study, we were
trying to find the reasons behind the back and forth of the programmer. The effect of the learning
environment on them. And raise our voice to give and ensure necessary supports for them.

## Why it’s important?
For a long time, I have been working with this community. I saw a lot of people doing well and a
lot of people stuck in the middle and a lot of people quitting it. And the ratio of quitting and
stuck in the middle is way more than who is doing well. But if we can ensure the necessary
supports and a good learning environment the results dramatically changes.

## What are the new things I have Accomplished?
I have found some interesting relationships among their learning environments, back and forth,
their knowledge sharing tendencies, passion for programming, etc.

## How I do that?
I collected around 115 data from various programming communities using questionnaires . The
questionaries are divided into some categories focusing on the performances, learning
environments, their strengths and weaknesses, distractions and their interest in programming.
There was a part where I had to do some validation and cleaning based on the requirements of
the analysis. Then I have used pandas and matplotlib to analyze and visualize the relationships
among the data.

## How do I test the results and what are our findings?
It’s more like a statistical analysis, where every data was self-explanatory. I tried to add some
relationships among them.

## Findings :

  ● First of all, there is no shortcut to success the more you practice the more you grow.

  ● The path became easier if you are guided by someone.
  ● Distractions and weakness are the facts they pull you down from the path
  ● We as a community or authority aren’t able to provide necessary supports for them
  ● Frustrations and lackings of supports lead them to quit programming.

## Future works:

  ● We could create a more balanced data set that can data from its core. Along with
  questionnaires we could arrange an in-person interview to collect data more precisely. It
  will take some effort but all the effort will be worth it.
  ● We could build more advanced and organized models to clean and process data. so
  working with big data is possible. And lead us to more precise results.
  ● Collect a lot of data from the root end, so that we can analyze a large programming
  community and find out what fits best for them.
  ● What we found most challenging through the research is finding the relationship between
  the data fields. It would be better to re-analyze and try to find some more interesting
  relationships among the data fields.

## Conclusion:
For me, it was a work that comes from the very deep of heart being a member of such a
wonderful community. I think the scope of the actual research is very large, it may take years to
perfect. I would love to say the finding of the study will help a lot to the community of problem
solvers. If we can give our best support and they can give their best potential we can expect
something really big gonna happens.
